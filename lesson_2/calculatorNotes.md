I wasn't sure if LS wanted me take make the language setting in a way where the user could just input something
to say waht language to use or just let them edit the file to change the language. I think it seemed like they were
saying the latter thing

Loan calculator:

I need to look into ways to deal with someone inputting years or months into my calculator

The program needs to:
1) Welcome the user
2) Ask the user for the loan amount (loanA)
3) Ask the user for their APR (rate)
4) Ask the user if they want to input months or years (m/y)
5) If yes to years (y) then multiply by 12. If yes to months then just is the input without doing any math on it

6) make a function to make the messages that come to the console a little nicer looking like in my other calculator
